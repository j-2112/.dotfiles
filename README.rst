Dotfiles Folder
===============

Overview
--------
This repo will hold our dotfiles (.vimrc, .basrc, .gitconfig, etc...) 
this will be used with mac and with chromebook

We can use the ``ln`` command on unix to create symbolic links from a source file
or dir to a new directory

1. Create a new link from source to target location 
   ``ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~./vimrc``

This is important to remember it is always actual file with info, to the link where programs read.
